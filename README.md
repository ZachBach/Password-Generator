# Password-Generator
Upon clicking generate user will first be asked how long of a password they wish to recieve.
After they will be asked if they would like to include numbers.
Then uppercase letters.
thirdly lowercase letters.
and last they will be asked if they want special character's.
if user does not pick at least one of these options they will be alerted they have to choose at least one.
Once user has set their parameters for their password it will randomly generate a password for them.
If user hits copy to clipboard their newly generated password will of course be copied to the clipboard.
I also included a Button on the top right of the screen that will clear the password if they would like to generate a new one.
